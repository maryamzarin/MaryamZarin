### 🚀 Projects

- ⚡ **Electron Desktop App – Egg Timer / Utility Tool**  
  Built a lightweight cross-platform desktop application using Electron and JavaScript.  
  Integrated custom UI components, file access, and system-level functionality for a productivity tool.

- 🚲 **Bike Redistribution Optimisation – Final Year Dissertation**  
  Analysed Santander Cycles data (600k+ entries per sheet) using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Folium) to visualise usage trends and cluster demand locations.  
  Applied K-Means clustering and NetworkX for route optimisation, solving Maximum Flow and Travelling Salesman subproblems.  
  Developed and evaluated Nearest-Neighbour and Match algorithms to minimise vehicle routing distances for redistributing bikes.

- 🧭 **KCL Campus Navigation App – Group Project**  
  Led a team of 6 using Agile methods to build a Django + JavaScript web app for students to access timetables, facility info, and office hours.  
  Created login and sign-up forms, model-based pages, class-based views, Bootstrap CSS layout, and comprehensive unit tests.

- 📍 **Live Traffic Incident Visualisation – Individual Project**  
  Developed a live map-based web app using JavaScript, HTML, and AJAX.  
  Integrated the Google Maps API to visualise traffic incidents from dynamic JSON data for selected UK cities.

- 🏠 **Airbnb Property Viewer – Group Project**  
  Created a JavaFX-based desktop application to browse Airbnb property listings on an interactive London map.  
  Implemented colour gradients based on popularity, added filters for property features, and used the Google Maps API for geographic visualisation.

- 🧪 **Predator-Prey Simulation – Pair Project**  
  Programmed a multi-species ecological simulation in Java using OOP.  
  Modelled survival conditions, reproduction, and population dynamics with adjustable parameters such as lifespan and birthrate.

  - 🍬 **Candy Crush Clone (Pygame)**  
  Recreated the classic game using Python and Pygame, applying object-oriented programming principles such as classes, iheritance and stack/queue management.
  Implemented full game logic for tile matching, animations, score tracking, and game state transitions.
